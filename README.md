OpenMole: plotting results
==========================

This project consists in a little plugin for OpenMole, a Computational Engine for Custom Simulation Experiments. It aims to provide some plots of the CSV results provided by OpenMole.

The project is discontinued but can be used waiting for an official solution. 

How it works
------------

In order to use it, you just have to run the Main with your CSV result file followed by the plot type which can be 'cloud' or 'histo' according to your needs.
